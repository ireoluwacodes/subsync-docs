# Troubleshooting

Common integration issues and how to fix them.

## Subscription stuck on `incomplete`

**Symptoms:** Checkout completed on Nomba but SubSync still shows `incomplete`.

**Checks:**

1. Is the inbound Nomba webhook URL correct? Copy it from **Settings → Nomba** in the dashboard (format: `{[base_url]}/webhooks/nomba/{tenant_id}`).
2. Is the webhook signing secret saved in SubSync **Settings → Nomba**?
3. Did Nomba show a successful delivery for the payment event? Check Nomba's webhook logs.
4. Resume checkout: `POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/subscriptions/:id/checkout`

If the above look correct, contact SubSync support with the subscription ID and payment timestamp.

## Renewals not running

**Symptoms:** `next_billing_at` passed but no invoice or charge.

**Checks:**

1. Does the subscription have a saved card (`payment_method_id` set)?
2. For transfer signups — was card captured before billing date? Without a card, the subscription is **canceled** on the billing date instead of renewing.
3. Is the subscription still `active` or `trialing` (not `canceled` / `paused`)?

If credentials and payment method look correct but nothing charged, contact support with `subscription_id` and `next_billing_at`.

## Transfer signup canceled at renewal

**Expected behavior** if no card was saved by `next_billing_at`.

**Fix:** Call `POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/subscriptions/:id/capture-payment-method` or send a portal link before the billing date. Reminder emails go out 7, 3, and 1 days before.

## `401 unauthorized` on API calls

- API key must include the `ssk_` prefix in the `Authorization: Bearer` header
- JWT may be expired — refresh via `GET {[base_url]}/api/v1/auth/refresh` (dashboard session only)
- Confirm you are calling `{[base_url]}/api/v1/...`

## `409 conflict` on checkout

Customer already has an `incomplete` subscription for that plan. Use:

```
POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/subscriptions/:id/checkout
```

## Invoice stuck on `processing`

Nomba sometimes returns async charge status. SubSync reconciles with Nomba automatically (typically within ~15 minutes). If it stays `processing` for longer, verify Nomba sandbox/production credentials in **Settings → Nomba**.

## Outbound webhooks not received

1. Endpoint URL must be **HTTPS** in production
2. Your server must return **2xx** within the timeout
3. Check `GET {[base_url]}/api/v1/webhook-endpoints/:id/deliveries` for failure reasons
4. For local dev, expose your app with ngrok (or similar) and register that HTTPS URL — SubSync calls **your** server, not the other way around

## Checkout emails not sending

- Enable **send checkout email** on checkout (`send_checkout_email: true`) or use the dashboard
- If emails still fail, copy `checkout_url` from the API response and share it manually while debugging

## Nomba `422 invalid_nomba_credentials`

Credentials failed token issue. Re-check client ID, secret, account ID, and environment (sandbox vs production) in **Settings → Nomba**.

## Local development tips

- Use Nomba **sandbox** credentials in the dashboard
- Point `success_url` / `cancel_url` at `http://localhost:...` while testing your UI
- Use ngrok (or similar) for your **outbound webhook** URL if you want real-time unlock during local dev

## Still stuck?

Gather:

- `subscription_id`, `tenant_id`
- Invoice ID and status
- Timestamp of Nomba payment
- Nomba webhook delivery status (from Nomba dashboard)

Contact SubSync support with the above.
