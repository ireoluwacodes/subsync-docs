# Quick Start

Get from zero to a paid subscription in Nomba sandbox. Sign up in the **SubSync dashboard**, connect your Nomba account, then call the SubSync API from your backend with your API key.

**API base URL:** `{[base_url]}/api/v1` (find yours in the dashboard; sandbox vs production charges depend on your Nomba environment setting).

## 1. Create your SubSync account (dashboard)

1. Sign up at the SubSync dashboard and complete onboarding.
2. Enter your **Nomba sandbox credentials** (`client_id`, `client_secret`, `account_id`, environment).
3. Copy and store your **API key** (`ssk_...`) — shown once at signup; rotate later under **Settings → API key** if needed.
4. Open **Settings → Nomba** and copy your **inbound webhook URL** (for Nomba dashboard setup).

Your API key is for server-to-server calls only. End users on your product never see it.

  You can create your first plan in the dashboard (**Plans → New plan**) before writing code. The steps below use the API so you can automate the same flow from your backend.
</Callout>

## 2. Connect Nomba webhooks (dashboard)

1. In **Nomba → Settings → Webhooks**, register the URL shown in SubSync **Settings → Nomba**.
2. Copy Nomba's webhook signing secret.
3. Paste it into SubSync **Settings → Nomba → Webhook secret** and save.

## 3. Create a plan

```http
POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/plans
Authorization: Bearer ssk_...
```

```json
{
  "name": "Pro",
  "amount": 100000,
  "currency": "NGN",
  "interval": "monthly",
  "trial_days": 0,
  "features": []
}
```

`amount` is in **kobo** (100000 = ₦1,000.00). Save the returned plan `id`.

## 4. Create a customer

```http
POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/customers
Authorization: Bearer ssk_...
```

```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "external_id": "your-platform-user-id",
  "metadata": {}
}
```

Save the customer `id`. Use `external_id` to link the SubSync customer to your platform user.

## 5. Start checkout

```http
POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/subscriptions/checkout
Authorization: Bearer ssk_...
```

```json
{
  "customer_id": "<customer-uuid>",
  "plan_id": "<plan-uuid>",
  "success_url": "https://yourapp.com/billing/success",
  "cancel_url": "https://yourapp.com/pricing",
  "send_checkout_email": false
}
```

**Response:** `checkout_url`, `subscription_id`, `status: incomplete`.

Redirect the user to `checkout_url`. They complete payment on Nomba's hosted page (card-only by default).

## 6. Wait for activation

After payment, Nomba notifies SubSync. The subscription moves out of `incomplete`:

| Plan type | Final state |
|-----------|---------------|
| No trial | `active`, first invoice `paid` |
| With trial | `trialing`, ₦100 card verification |

Poll `GET {[base_url]}/api/v1/subscriptions/:id` or listen for [outbound webhooks](/docs/webhooks) on your app.

## 7. Unlock access on your platform

Register where SubSync should notify your app:

```http
POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/webhook-endpoints
Authorization: Bearer ssk_...
```

```json
{
  "url": "https://yourapp.com/webhooks/subsync",
  "events": ["subscription.updated", "invoice.paid"],
  "is_active": true
}
```

When `subscription.updated` arrives with `state: active`, grant the user access in your product.

## Local development

- Use **Nomba sandbox** credentials in the SubSync dashboard during development.
- Point `success_url` / `cancel_url` at `http://localhost:...` while testing your frontend (HTTPS required in production).
- Expose your **outbound webhook** URL to the internet (e.g. ngrok) if you want real-time unlock during local dev.
