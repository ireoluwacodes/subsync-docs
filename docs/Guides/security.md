# Security

How SubSync protects merchant credentials, payment data, and webhook integrity.

## Per-merchant Nomba isolation

Each tenant stores their own Nomba OAuth credentials. SubSync:

- Encrypts `nomba_client_secret` at rest (AES-256-GCM)
- Encrypts Nomba webhook signing keys at rest
- Calls Nomba with **that tenant's** token and `accountId`
- Never pools money across merchants

There is no shared Nomba parent account in SubSync.

## API authentication

| Token | Storage recommendation |
|-------|-------------------------|
| API key (`ssk_`) | Secrets manager, env var — never client-side |
| JWT access token | Memory or short-lived storage in dashboard |
| Refresh token | httpOnly cookie only |

Rotate API keys via `POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/settings/api-key/rotate` if compromised.

## Inbound Nomba webhooks

Nomba signs payloads with `nomba-signature` and `nomba-timestamp`. SubSync verifies using the merchant's webhook secret stored in settings.

- Register tenant-specific URL: `{[base_url]}/webhooks/nomba/{tenant_id}`
- Never use a shared webhook endpoint across tenants
- Reject replayed or unsigned payloads

## Outbound SubSync webhooks

Deliveries to your app include `SubSync-Signature`. Verify on your server before changing subscription state in your database.

  Treat webhook endpoints like admin APIs. Unverified handlers let anyone forge "payment succeeded" events.
</Callout>

## PCI and card data

SubSync does not require you to collect card numbers. Checkout and portal flows redirect to **Nomba hosted pages**. You receive tokens (`token_key`) via webhook, not PAN data.

Do not log full webhook bodies in production — they may contain sensitive fields.

## Production checklist

| Check | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| Nomba credentials | Valid sandbox or production values in **Settings → Nomba** |
| Inbound Nomba webhook | Registered in Nomba dashboard using URL from SubSync settings |
| Your redirect URLs | HTTPS in production (`success_url`, `cancel_url`) |
| Outbound webhook URL | HTTPS; verify `SubSync-Signature` on every delivery |

## Environment secrets

Never commit API keys or Nomba client secrets in your app's source repo. Use environment variables or a secrets manager on **your** infrastructure.

## Outbound webhook HTTPS

Production webhook URLs must use HTTPS. SubSync signs every delivery — verify signatures on your server before trusting payload data.
