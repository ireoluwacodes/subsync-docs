# Card Capture

When a customer pays their first subscription period via **bank transfer**, SubSync activates the subscription but does not have a saved card. Renewals require a tokenized card before `next_billing_at`.

## Why this exists

Transfer checkout (`allow_bank_transfer: true`) collects the first payment without a `tokenKey`. The subscription is `active` with `payment_method_id: null` and `metadata.awaiting_payment_method: true`.

Without a card:

- SubSync sends reminder emails at **7, 3, and 1 day(s)** before renewal
- On the billing date, the subscription is **canceled** (not charged, not `past_due`)

Customers must add a card before renewal.

## Capture endpoint

```
POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/subscriptions/:id/capture-payment-method
Authorization: Bearer ssk_...
```

```json
{
  "success_url": "https://app.acme.com/billing/card-added",
  "cancel_url": "https://app.acme.com/billing",
  "send_email": false
}
```

**Response `200`:**

```json
{
  "checkout_url": "https://checkout.nomba.com/...",
  "order_reference": "capture-<subscription-id>"
}
```

This is a **card-only** Nomba checkout (₦100 verification). Redirect the customer to `checkout_url`.

## Webhook completion

When Nomba sends `payment_success` for order ref `capture-{subscription_id}`:

1. SubSync saves the payment method from `tokenKey`
2. Clears `awaiting_payment_method`
3. Sets `payment_method_id` on the subscription
4. If billing was waiting, attempts renewal immediately

## When to show "Add card" in your UI

Check the subscription:

```
GET {[base_url]}/api/v1/subscriptions/:id
```

Show the prompt when:

- `payment_method_id` is `null`, and
- `state` is `active` or `trialing`, and
- `metadata.awaiting_payment_method` is `true` (transfer path)

Or proactively for any active subscription without a payment method approaching `next_billing_at`.

## Alternative: customer portal

Issue a portal link instead of calling capture directly:

```
POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/portal/token
{ "subscription_id": "<uuid>", "expires_in_hours": 72 }
```

The portal lets customers update their payment method via Nomba checkout. See [Customer portal](/guides/customer-portal).

## Email reminders

SubSync sends:

1. **Immediately** after transfer activation — "save a card for renewals"
2. **7, 3, 1 days** before `next_billing_at` — urgency reminders with portal/capture link

Reminder emails include links to your customer's portal or card-capture flow.

## Integrator flow

```
Transfer checkout completes → subscription active, no card
→ Your app shows "Add payment method"
→ POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/subscriptions/:id/capture-payment-method
→ Redirect to checkout_url
→ Webhook saves card → renewals work
```
