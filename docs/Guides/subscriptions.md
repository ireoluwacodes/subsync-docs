# Subscriptions

Subscriptions connect a customer to a plan and drive billing cycles, renewals, and lifecycle state.

## States

| State | Meaning | Typical action |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| `incomplete` | Awaiting first checkout payment | Resend checkout link |
| `trialing` | Trial active, card on file | Show trial end date |
| `active` | Paid and renewing | Normal access |
| `past_due` | Payment failed, in dunning | Prompt card update / retry invoice |
| `paused` | Billing paused | Show resume date |
| `canceled` | Ended | Read-only |
| `expired` | Trial ended without conversion | Read-only |

## Recommended: checkout signup

```
POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/subscriptions/checkout
```

See [Subscription checkout](/docs/subscription-checkout).

## Direct create (card already tokenized)

When you already have a Nomba `token_key`:

```
POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/payment-methods
POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/subscriptions
```

```json
{
  "customer_id": "<uuid>",
  "plan_id": "<uuid>",
  "payment_method_id": "<uuid>"
}
```

- Non-trial plan + payment method → **immediate charge**
- Trial plan → enters `trialing` without full plan charge until trial ends

Skip this path for customer-facing signup — use checkout instead.

## List and filter

```
GET {[base_url]}/api/v1/subscriptions?state=active&customer_id=<uuid>&page=1&per_page=20
```

## Cancel

```
POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/subscriptions/:id/cancel
```

```json
{
  "cancel_at_period_end": true,
  "reason": "customer requested"
}
```

- `cancel_at_period_end: true` — access until period end, then canceled
- `cancel_at_period_end: false` — cancel immediately

Transfer signups without a card are **canceled automatically** on the billing date if no payment method was saved (reason: `no_payment_method_at_renewal`).

## Pause and resume

```
POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/subscriptions/:id/pause
{ "pause_ends_at": "2026-08-01T00:00:00Z" }

POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/subscriptions/:id/resume
```

Billing stops while paused. `next_billing_at` adjusts on resume.

## Upgrade

Preview proration:

```
GET {[base_url]}/api/v1/subscriptions/:id/upgrade/preview?new_plan_id=<uuid>
```

Apply upgrade:

```
POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/subscriptions/:id/upgrade
{ "new_plan_id": "<uuid>" }
```

Creates a proration invoice when applicable.

## State history

```
GET {[base_url]}/api/v1/subscriptions/:id/transitions
```

Audit log of state changes with reason and actor.

## Key fields on subscription object

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `current_period_start` / `current_period_end` | Active billing window |
| `next_billing_at` | When renewal is attempted |
| `trial_ends_at` | Trial expiry (if trialing) |
| `payment_method_id` | Saved card for renewals |
| `metadata.awaiting_payment_method` | Transfer signup needs card capture |

## Renewal (background)

SubSync charges at `next_billing_at`. No API call needed for normal renewals. Failures move subscription to `past_due` and trigger dunning.
