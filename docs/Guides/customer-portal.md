# Customer Portal

Tokenized self-service links let customers cancel or update their payment method without logging into your app or the SubSync dashboard.

## Issue a portal token (merchant API)

```
POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/portal/token
Authorization: Bearer ssk_... or JWT
```

```json
{
  "subscription_id": "<uuid>",
  "expires_in_hours": 72
}
```

**Response:** portal URL or token (implementation returns a token used in public routes).

Build the link:

```
{[base_url]}/portal/{token}
```

Email it to the customer or show a "Manage billing" button in your app.

## Public portal routes

No SubSync auth — the token is the credential.

| Method | Path | Action |
|--------|------|--------|
| `GET` | `{[base_url]}/portal/:token` | View subscription summary |
| `POST` | `{[base_url]}/portal/:token/cancel` | Cancel subscription |
| `POST` | `{[base_url]}/portal/:token/update-payment-method` | Returns Nomba checkout URL (card-only) |

## Update payment method

`POST {[base_url]}/portal/:token/update-payment-method` returns a Nomba hosted checkout URL. Customer completes ₦100 card verification. Webhook saves `tokenKey` to their subscription.

Use this when:

- Renewal failed and customer needs a new card
- Transfer signup needs a card before billing date
- Customer wants to replace an expired card

Same outcome as [Card capture](/guides/card-capture) API, but customer-initiated via link.

## Cancel via portal

Customer can cancel at period end or immediately depending on portal implementation and subscription state. Your app should still listen for `subscription.canceled` webhooks to revoke access.

## Dashboard pattern

On subscription detail page:

1. **Send portal link** button → `POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/portal/token` → email or copy link
2. Same UX as "Resend checkout link" for incomplete subscriptions

## Security notes

- Tokens expire (`expires_in_hours`)
- Treat portal URLs like password reset links — single-purpose, time-limited
- Portal links use HTTPS
