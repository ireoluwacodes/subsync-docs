# Build with AI

SubSync ships an OpenAPI spec designed for LLM-assisted integration. Point your coding agent at the spec rather than guessing endpoint shapes.

## OpenAPI URL

```
{[base_url]}/openapi.json
```

The spec includes:

- All **API key** integrator routes (plans, customers, subscriptions, invoices, webhooks, portal)
- Required `responses` on every operation (validates in Postman and most OpenAPI tools)
- `apiKeyAuth` security scheme — `Authorization: Bearer ssk_...`

It **excludes** dashboard auth, settings, and analytics.

## Recommended workflow

1. **Import OpenAPI** into your agent context (Cursor, Claude, Copilot, etc.).
2. **Provide your API key** via environment variable — never paste production keys into chat logs.
3. **Describe the user journey**, not individual endpoints:

   > "When a user clicks Subscribe on my SaaS, create a SubSync customer if needed, start checkout, redirect to checkout_url, and unlock access when subscription.updated webhook fires with state active."

4. **Cross-check** generated code against [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start) and [Subscription checkout](/docs/subscription-checkout).

## Example prompts

### Integrator signup flow

```
Using SubSync OpenAPI at {[base_url]}/openapi.json:

Implement a Node.js handler for POST /subscribe that:
1. Creates or finds a SubSync customer by external_id
2. Calls POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/subscriptions/checkout with success_url and cancel_url
3. Returns { checkoutUrl } to the frontend

Auth: Authorization: Bearer process.env.SUBSYNC_API_KEY
```

### Webhook receiver

```
Write an Express route for SubSync outbound webhooks.
Verify SubSync-Signature header.
On subscription.updated with state "active", set user.subscriptionActive = true in our DB.
On invoice.payment_failed, send a dunning email.
```

### Transfer + card capture

```
Our checkout uses allow_bank_transfer: true.
After Nomba payment_success, subscription may be active without payment_method_id.
Implement a "Add card for renewals" button that calls
POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/subscriptions/:id/capture-payment-method and redirects to checkout_url.
```

## Postman collection

Generate locally:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_postman_collection.py > postman/collection.json
```

The collection includes **Start Checkout**, **Start Checkout (with bank transfer)**, and **Capture Payment Method** requests with test scripts that save `subscription_id`.

## What to tell the model about money

- Amounts are in **minor units** (kobo for NGN): `100000` = ₦1,000.00
- Trial checkout charges **₦100** for card verification, not the full plan price
- Non-trial checkout charges the **full plan amount** on first payment

## Pitfalls for LLMs

| Mistake | Correct approach |
|---------|------------------|
| Embedding Nomba card fields in your UI | Use `POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/subscriptions/checkout` → redirect to `checkout_url` |
| Forgetting outbound webhooks | Register `POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/webhook-endpoints` so your app learns when checkout completes |
| Using JWT for server integration | Use `ssk_` API key |
| Expecting transfer renewals without a card | Call capture-payment-method or portal before `next_billing_at` |
| Calling `{[base_url]}/api/v1/auth/register` from integrator code | Register once in dashboard; store API key securely |
