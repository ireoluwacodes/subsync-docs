# Outbound Webhooks

SubSync can POST events to your application when subscriptions, invoices, or payment methods change. Use this to unlock product access, sync CRM records, or trigger your own emails.

## Register an endpoint

```
POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/webhook-endpoints
Authorization: Bearer ssk_...
```

```json
{
  "url": "https://yourapp.com/webhooks/subsync",
  "events": ["subscription.updated", "invoice.paid"],
  "is_active": true
}
```

Use `"events": ["*"]` for all event types. Maximum **5 endpoints** per tenant.

## Event types

| Event | When |
|-------|------|
| `subscription.created` | New subscription record |
| `subscription.updated` | State or fields changed |
| `subscription.canceled` | Subscription canceled |
| `invoice.created` | New invoice |
| `invoice.paid` | Invoice successfully paid |
| `invoice.payment_failed` | Charge failed |
| `payment_method.attached` | Card saved to customer |

## Payload shape

Deliveries are JSON POSTs to your URL. Payload includes event type and resource snapshot (e.g. `id`, `state` for subscriptions).

Inspect recent deliveries:

```
GET {[base_url]}/api/v1/webhook-endpoints/:id/deliveries
```

## Signature verification

Each delivery includes a `SubSync-Signature` header. Verify before trusting the body:

1. Read raw request body (do not parse JSON first)
2. Compute HMAC with your tenant's webhook signing secret
3. Compare to header value

The signing secret is generated at tenant registration (`WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET` env or per-tenant secret in DB). Store it securely on your server.

  Always verify signatures in production. Unverified webhooks are an easy path to fraudulent "paid" states.
</Callout>

## Recommended events by use case

| Your goal | Subscribe to |
|-----------|--------------|
| Unlock SaaS access after signup | `subscription.updated`, `invoice.paid` |
| Revoke access on cancel | `subscription.canceled` |
| Dunning / payment failed emails | `invoice.payment_failed` |
| Sync billing to CRM | `subscription.updated`, `invoice.paid` |

## Checkout unlock pattern

```
1. User completes Nomba checkout
2. Nomba → SubSync inbound webhook
3. SubSync → your outbound webhook: subscription.updated { state: "active" }
4. Your handler: grant access for customer external_id
```

Map SubSync customer → your user via `external_id` set at customer creation.

## Retry behavior

Failed deliveries (non-2xx, timeout) are retried automatically. Check delivery logs in the dashboard or via `GET {[base_url]}/api/v1/webhook-endpoints/:id/deliveries` when debugging.

## Manage endpoints

| Method | Path |
|--------|------|

| `PUT` | `{[base_url]}/api/v1/webhook-endpoints/:id` |
| `DELETE` | `{[base_url]}/api/v1/webhook-endpoints/:id` |
