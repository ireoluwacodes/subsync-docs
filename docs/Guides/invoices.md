# Invoices & Dunning

Every charge creates an invoice. Failed renewals enter dunning until paid or exhausted.

## Invoice statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `open` | Awaiting payment |
| `processing` | Charge submitted to Nomba, awaiting confirmation |
| `paid` | Successfully collected |
| `void` | Canceled / invalidated |
| `uncollectible` | Written off after dunning |

## List and retrieve

```
GET {[base_url]}/api/v1/invoices?status=open&customer_id=<uuid>&subscription_id=<uuid>
GET {[base_url]}/api/v1/invoices/:id
```

## PDF download

```
GET {[base_url]}/api/v1/invoices/:id/pdf
```

Returns PDF bytes (or redirect to Cloudinary URL when configured). Branding comes from tenant settings.

## Void

```
POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/invoices/:id/void
```

Only for open invoices. SubSync voids renewal invoices when canceling subscriptions that never had a payment method.

## Retry failed charge

```
POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/invoices/:id/retry
```

Manually retry after customer updates card. Useful when subscription is `past_due`.

## How invoices are created

| Trigger | Invoice type |
|---------|--------------|
| Checkout payment | First period / verification |
| Subscription create with PM | Immediate charge (non-trial) |
| Worker at `next_billing_at` | Renewal |
| Plan upgrade | Proration invoice |

## Dunning

When renewal fails:

1. Subscription → `past_due`
2. SubSync runs configured dunning steps (`PATCH {[base_url]}/api/v1/settings/dunning`)
3. Retries charge after `delay_days`
4. Emails customer (when Resend configured)

Configure steps:

```json
PATCH {[base_url]}/api/v1/settings/dunning
{
  "steps": [
    { "delay_days": 1, "action": "retry" },
    { "delay_days": 3, "action": "retry" },
    { "delay_days": 7, "action": "retry" }
  ]
}
```

### Processing invoices

Nomba charges may return async (`processing`). SubSync reconciles with Nomba periodically and finalizes status automatically.

## Transfer signups without card

Transfer customers do **not** get a renewal invoice if no card is saved — subscription is **canceled** on billing date instead of going `past_due`. See [Card capture](/guides/card-capture).

## Dashboard vs API

| Action | API |
|--------|-----|
| View invoice list | `GET {[base_url]}/api/v1/invoices` |
| Download PDF | `GET {[base_url]}/api/v1/invoices/:id/pdf` |
| Retry failed payment | `POST {[base_url]}/api/v1/invoices/:id/retry` |
| Customer update card | Portal or capture-payment-method |

## Webhooks

Listen for:

- `invoice.paid` — record revenue, send receipt
- `invoice.payment_failed` — trigger your own dunning UX
